# Project: Analyzing customers behavior of a fintech with SQL

## Business Problem

Analyzing user engagement data to optimize the launch of a new instant money transfer service in the Customer Journey of a financial service

## Introduction

Bankverse is a fintech company specialized in bank transfers operating in the United States. They are planning to launch a new instant money transfer service in the United States of America. (Note: They don't have a system like PIX in Brazil over there). To ensure the success of this launch, the General Product Manager (GPM) would like to gather essential information to determine the best date for releasing this new feature.

The primary goal is to reach the maximum number of users possible. To achieve this, the GPM wants to launch the product on a specific day and time when user engagement is at its peak. Additionally, they aim to identify the priority for developing the product for specific operating systems to ensure that it is available to the widest possible user base on the release date.

## Objectives

- Analyze customer behavior data to identify the most engaging days and times.
- Determine the optimal launch date for the new instant transfer service.
- Prioritize the development of the product for specific operating systems to maximize user accessibility.

## Sources

- The given database contains information from April 21, 2023 to April 29, 2023, stored in Metabase. 

## Data Analysis

In order to achieve these objectives, the following steps will be taken:

1. **Data Collection**: SQL were used as our primary tool to gather user interaction data, including user and transaction IDs, engagement dates, and operating systems, from our database.
3. **Business Inteligence Analysis**: Utilize BI tools and techniques to determine the most engaging days and times.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Develop data visualization dashboards to track user activity and engagement over time.
5. **Recommendations**: Based on the analysis, make recommendations for the optimal launch date and prioritize the development for specific operating systems.

## Technologies and Tools

- Data analysis and visualization tools.
- Database and data storage tools.
- Employ SQL for database queries. 
- Any other relevant tools.
